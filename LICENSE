We encourage developers, security researchers, and enthusiasts to:  

- **Enhance the Terraform script** to add more cloud platforms or security features  
- **Integrate new logging & monitoring tools** for better attack visibility  
- **Improve the honeypot's deception techniques** to capture more attacker data
